log in to google ai studio
create new api key > new project 

copy api key to clipboard > curl code  and pase in to post manexample:

curl "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.0-flash:generateContent" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-goog-api-key: AIzaSyDUftPaIxInykUGoLD7mLWQgHbBoeSi9Eo' \
  -X POST \
  -d '{
    "contents": [
      {
        "parts": [
          {
            "text": "Explain how AI works in a few words"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }'

  it will automatically format wihtin postman

  to change response type just change the text in "text": "your text here"
  change in this part :

           " {
            "text": "Explain how AI works in a few words"
          }"

    then click send

    you will get response from the api

    now to integrate it to our js code, we dont have to code from first
    in postman top right corner there is a code button (</>), click on it
    then select javascript fetch from the list

    and copy the code

    const myHeaders = new Headers();
myHeaders.append("Content-Type", "application/json");
myHeaders.append("X-goog-api-key", "AIzaSyDUftPaIxInykUGoLD7mLWQgHbBoeSi9Eo");

const raw = JSON.stringify({
  "contents": [
    {
      "parts": [
        {
          "text": "Explain how AI works in a few words"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
});

const requestOptions = {
  method: "POST",
  headers: myHeaders,
  body: raw,
  redirect: "follow"
};

fetch("https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.0-flash:generateContent", requestOptions)
  .then((response) => response.text())
  .then((result) => console.log(result))
  .catch((error) => console.error(error));
